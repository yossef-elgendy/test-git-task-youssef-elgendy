   1. **Clone** this repo and setup Magento by running `npm install` and `npm run start`. This is simple CMA app with sample data.
   2. Create a new branch from `production`.

   4. Commit the changes
   5. Push the changes to your forked repository
   6. Open a PR to merge the changes to the `dev` branch of your forked repository

#### 2. Expected results:
   1. The `MarkShust_DisableTwoFactorAuth` module should be installed and working on `production` and `dev` branches.
   2. The `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files should be updated with the new module.
   3. The `composer.lock` file should be *integrable*. This means that the SHA in the `composer.lock` file should be up to date.
   4. The `production` branch **shouldn't have any commits, modules or files** from the `dev` branch.

#### 3. Testing:
   1. You will have to test the repo running `npm run test` to make sure the module is working correctly on both `dev` and `production` branches.

### Notes
- Make sure to follow the workflow from the course.
- Make sure to resolve conflicts properly when merging PRs.
- If you have switched branches that have different modules and/or versions installed (AKA different `composer.lock` files), you will need to run `composer install` make sure the `vendor` folder is up to date, since the `composer.lock` file is integrable.
- If you have broken `composer.lock`, you can run `composer update --lock` to fix it.

### Submission
- Submit the link to your forked repository with the PRs opened and merged.
- Submit two screenshots of the `npm run test` output for both `dev` and `production` branches.

### Useful resources
- Moodle course for the workflow explanation.
- Make sure you understand how Composer works [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) (and understand package manager logic in abstract)
- `composer --help`, `composer <command> --help` in CLI is giving a lot of useful information too.
